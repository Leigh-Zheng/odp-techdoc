ODP Mission
         With more teams at the General Services Administration (GSA) leveraging Development and Operations (DevOps) practices, ensuring effective security practices has become paramount. The ODP aims to ensure that GSA teams who practice DevOps, adopt a security forward thinking.



Program Goals:

Security and Quality 
The ODP aims to ensure security is considered and implemented in all design and operational phases. The ODP aims to provide full security support in areas including Incidence Response, Security Automation, Compliance, and more.

Help facilitate cultural shift
Unfortunately, security is often associated with compliance at GSA. While an important part of the system life cycle, security is not just compliance. The ODP aims to shift the agencies thinking of just ATO’s and Compliance to everyday considerations and operations. The ODP wants everyone to simply just adopt a “How can we do this securely?” mindset. Furthermore, we aim to shift the thinking of “security as engineers over there” to they are part of our team. 

Improve silos and communication barriers
Too often, our only engagement with system teams occurs when there is an incident or when there is an assessment. Furthermore, the lack of sharing of information and code leads to “rebuilding the wheel” development cycles. The ODP aims to provide a simple and consistent communication channel where solutions, code, and more can be shared amongst teams to make development cycles efficient and secure. 

Provide security services through integrated engineer
Most often OCISO security services are only available during A&A, Incident Response and for limited ISSO function. Security services are provided through different division and teams. By placing integrated security engineer in DevSecOps team, we will deliver all security services through integrated engineer. Integrated engineer will be your ISSO and point of contact for all security related functions. 



Defining DevSecOps at GSA



        DevSecOps is an iteration of the term DevOps. DevOps originates from the idea of taking previously two siloed groups, Development and Operations. Then by using practices, tools, and a new cultural approach, one can build and deliver applications and/or services at greatly increased speed and at scale. DevSecOps makes security an equal partner in the workflow. 


        As with DevOps, DevSecOps can have different definitions depending on the industry or system owner. It can range from “simple cross functional collaborative team including IT security personal” to “Self sustained, highly agile, self managed team driving cultural shift”. While this document will not establish a universal definition of DevSecOps, it will define how the ODP defines it.


        At a high level, the ODP defines DevSecOps as “Integrating security into all the workflows and practices of DevOps.” Or as DevSecOps.org’s statement reads “everyone is responsible for security” Due to the complexity and nuance of DevSecOps, the following sections expand on defining what it is and what it is not. 

 

What DevSecOps Is Not
It is not a set of security tools

It is not automating a security function

It is not solely security compliance

What DevSecOps Is
DevSecOps is embracing a culture where everyone is responsible for security

DevSecOps is considering security in all aspects of the system life cycle. From the first system kickoff to the final decommissioning. 

DevSecOps is using the already existing DevOps practices and methodologies to implement, enforce, and monitor security. 

DevSecOps implements paved roads. Paved Roads includes items such as pre-approved architectures, processes, etc that wouldn’t need additional review or approvals.


What ODP program means for application team?
Application team can officially integrate with OCISO DevSecOps Program (ODP)
Application team agree to ODP rules of engagement
ODP will vet application team, and decide if team is right fit for integration or not
ODP program integrates security engineer with application team for building GSA DevSecOps teams
Integrated security engineer will work as part of DevSecOps and will take specific IT security responsibility
Integrated security engineer could be your ISSO and single point of contact for all GSA IT Security related support, based on agreement between teams
Application team will abide by ODP DevSecOps process as we mature and develop standard process for integrated DevsecOps teams for efficient security processes, reviews and approvals.  
Is there any other way ODP program helps GSA DevSecOps teams?
As we mature,  in collaboration with other GSA DevSecOps team we intent to:

Built DevSecOps teams focused security related contents, wiki, how to, do's /don'ts and standard process.
Build centralized security code repository for sharing and cross collaboration between GSA DevSecOps teams
Build reference architecture in collaboration with GSA DevSecOps team for different GSA platforms 
Host security forums for DevSecOps teams 
Build common platform for all DevSecOps teams where they can collaborate, contribute, ask question and get clarification related on security related topics, best practices, tools and capability.

    Note: We have limited resource and we are just starting. We will not be able to support everyone , with everything. We expect collaboration and knowledge sharing with all the teams to grow and mature this program.
How do we integrate with OCISO DevSecOps program?
ODP is planning to integrate with few application/in teams in year 2019 as pilot program. If your team is interested please send email at ociso-devsecops@gsa.gov . We will contact back, schedule calls, share our program  guide and brief your team on next steps. ODP is designed to be  agile and flexible program. We will work with our integrated teams to build secure environment and support DevSecOps effort.
